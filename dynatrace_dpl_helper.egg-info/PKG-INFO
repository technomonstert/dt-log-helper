# Dynatrace Log Rule Helper

Generate Dynatrace log parsing rules from real log examples — without writing DPL by hand.

Dynatrace log processing rules use Dynatrace Pattern Language (DPL), a small but strict domain-specific language.
Writing these rules manually is slow, error-prone, and difficult to validate.

This tool takes a sample log line (JSON or plain text) and produces a ready-to-paste Dynatrace log processing rule.

No DPL expertise required.

## Why This Tool Exists

In Dynatrace, extracting fields from logs requires defining log processing rules using DPL constructs like:

- PARSE
- LD
- SPACE?
- INT, FLOAT, STRING

Common problems:
- One missing token breaks the rule
- No syntax validation in the UI
- No preview or test extraction
- Difficult to translate human-readable logs into DPL grammar

This tool solves that by translating log examples into valid DPL rules automatically.

---

## What This Tool Is (and Is Not)

### What it is
- A helper utility that converts log examples into Dynatrace log parsing rules
- A DPL rule generator
- A copy-paste companion for Dynatrace Log Monitoring configuration

### What it is not
- Not a Dynatrace API client
- Not a log ingestion tool
- Not a replacement for Dynatrace log processing
- Not a requirement to know Python

Python is only the implementation language — users do not need Python knowledge.

---

## Who Should Use This

- Dynatrace engineers working with log parsing
- SREs and observability engineers creating log-based attributes
- Anyone tired of manually writing DPL rules
- Teams building dashboards, alerts, and metrics from logs

---

## Installation

### From PyPI (recommended)

pip install dynatrace-dpl-helper

### From source

git clone https://github.com/technomonstert/dt-log-helper.git
cd dt-log-helper
pip install -e .

---

## Quick Start

### Input log example

{
  "content": "Billed Duration: 5034"
}

### Command

dynatrace-dpl-helper --file sample.json --literal "Billed Duration:" --value 5034 --type INT --alias aws.billed.duration

### Output (DPL rule)

PARSE(content, "LD 'Billed Duration:' SPACE? INT:aws.billed.duration")

Paste this directly into:

Dynatrace → Settings → Log Monitoring → Processing → Add processing rule
